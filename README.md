# Motor Driver BTS7960B and a PCA9685 servo controler
This is a set of Python programs to control two DC motors with two BTS7960 motor drivers and single PCA9685 servo controler board.

!!!!!!! THIS IS A VERY EARLY ALPHA VERSION !!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!! BTS7960-H-Bridge-PCA9685.py !!!!!!!!!!!

Due to the fact that the Raspberry Pi has problems to generate four independent PWM signals I searched for a cheap solution.
I ended up in the combination of the PCA9685 servo controler and two BTS7960 motor drivers boards.
