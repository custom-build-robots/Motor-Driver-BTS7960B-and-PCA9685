# Motor-Driver-BTS7960B-and-PCA9685
This is a set of Python programs to control two DC motors with two BTS7960 motor drivers and single PCA9685 servo controler board. Due to the fact that the Raspberry Pi has problems to generate four independent PWM signals I searched for a cheap solution.
I ended up in the combination of the PCA9685 servo controler and two BTS7960 motor drivers boards.
